Task weight: 1%

You have access to muliple clusters from your main terminal through `kubectl` contexts. Write all those context names into `/opt/course/1/contexts` .

Next write a command to display the current context into `/opt/course/1/context_default_kubectl.sh`, the command should use `kubectl`.

Finally write a second command doing the same thing into `/opt/course/1/context_default_no_kubecth.sh`, but without the use of `kubectl`.
