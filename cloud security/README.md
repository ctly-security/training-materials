## Compliance 
### MAS
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singaporeâ€™s central bank and integrated financial regulator. MAS also works with the financial industry to develop Singapore as a dynamic international financial centre.

All financial industry (FI) will need to obtain the license from MAS, before any business can be done that provides financial services such as bank, investment, insurances and stock market. these companiees are all regulated by MAS.

1 common document that FI uses for compliance purpose is the "Technology Risk Mangement" Guideline (TRM). It is a document that MAS wants all FI to compply with, and every year, MAS will audit the FI for regulatory purpose.

Hence it is crucial to be in compliance with it.

### NIST Framework
NIST Framework is a common tool that cyber security professional uses to hep organization identify the risks and implement the appropriate security controls.

Typically NIST Framework will cover the 5 domains, which are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## Security Vulnerability and Hardening
### CIS Benchmark
CIS Benchmark is widely use to hardening and securing services, databases and servers.

It recommends a set of configuration for each of the services that reduces the threat surface of a service.

Many misconfiguration may occur on services or endpoints, which leads to an increase in threat surface and exposure, hence it is important to have the serivces harden base on CIS Benchmark.

This is fairly important as many data breaches incident are due to misconfiguration of services. For example, having a database that is publicly accessible.

### CVE
CVE is the common language for identified vulnerability.

Whenever a security researcher has found a vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious user, it will be tagged with a number commonly known as Common Vulnerability and Exposure, CVE.
This will be kept it as a record and tag it accordingly, and it's a common langauge for that particular vulnerability.

An example of a Apple phone vulnerability:
