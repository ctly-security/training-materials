All financial industry (FI) will need to obtain the license from MAS, before any business can be done that provides financial services such as bank, investment, insurances and stock market. these companiees are all regulated by MAS.

1 common document that FI uses for compliance purpose is the "Technology Risk Mangement" Guideline (TRM). It is a document that MAS wants all FI to compply with, and every year, MAS will audit the FI for regulatory purpose.

Hence it is crucial to be in compliance with it.
